# Corrosion Detection Using Machine Learning


---

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project presents a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** based deep learning solution to automatically detect corrosion on industrial machinery and components from images. Using a **self-curated dataset** of corroded and non-corroded surfaces, the model classifies images with high accuracy, enabling early detection and preventive maintenance in industrial environments.

## üèÜ Status: Completed

The model has been successfully developed, trained, and tested with promising performance metrics, ready for integration into larger industrial inspection systems or AI-powered applications.

## üîç Features

- Developed a robust **CNN model** for corrosion detection.
- Employed **image preprocessing** and augmentation techniques with **OpenCV** to improve model generalization.
- Utilized **TensorFlow** and **Keras** to build, train, and validate the model.
- Achieved high accuracy in distinguishing corroded vs non-corroded images.
- Modular and extensible pipeline for easy retraining and dataset updates.
